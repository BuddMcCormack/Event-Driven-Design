### Describes the design and event flow of the system.

The design I had intended for was an environmental puzzle game which few items could be used to create a wide variety of playable puzzles and scenarios.  The event system passed data to it's subscribed listeners which allowed the objects to interact with each other without knowing about each other.  Basically mitigating as many dependancies as possible and making the project easier to work with from a design standpoint.

### Explains how events improve modularity and gameplay responsiveness.

The event system allowed for simple interactions between objects to expand into a wide variety of possible outcome and experiences.   The gameplay responsiveness was heightened by the emergence of these new possible outcomes, by being allowed to take multiple approaches to any scenario.

### Reflects on challenges and solutions during development.

Most challenging was probably the initial implementation of the event system, although that being said once I got it to work the rest of the experience went fairly smooth.  My solutions to challenges faced during development were
